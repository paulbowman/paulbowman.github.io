      <p class="center para-default-settings">I am a driven and ambitious political science student at Purdue University Fort Wayne, passionate about public service and political engagement. Currently, I work at Tipton Law Group, coordinating administrative functions for the 14-person firm. This includes technology integration, marketing, and communications. Leveraging tech, I automate workflows and serve as the liaison between the firm and its municipal clients, ensuring efficient internal communication and responses.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="center para-default-settings">Prior to my current role, I contributed to Jim Banks' Senate campaign in Indiana's 2024 primary, playing a key role in ground operations and gathering hundreds of signatures. Additionally, I assisted with Wendy Davis' congressional campaign and various county races, gaining valuable political strategy experience and establishing connections across Northeast Indiana.</p>
